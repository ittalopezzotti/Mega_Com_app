multiple communications system for sending information
The main idea of this project is to make the most of the number of serial ports of an electronic card, with the objective of proposing necessary communications for the management of information;
Its configuration is given by 1 HC05 Bluetooth for communications via cell phone with the objective of viewing data on voltages, temperatures, humidity and simple changes in values while moving;
The second Bluetooth HC05 is to send information through a tablet and be able to see the graph of gas, particulate, temperature, etc. sensor values in real time; 
The third communication port is intended for a WIFI modem with the objective of allowing Internet communications with the server and downloading data.
